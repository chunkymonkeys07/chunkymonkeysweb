    <h1>How it all began</h1>
    <p>We started as classmates at School, never really the closest friends. Then came one random movie plan in 10th gradeâ€”and thatâ€™s where everything changed.

Since then, itâ€™s been laughs, fights, late-night talks, and a bond that only grew stronger. Sure, we had our little dramas (who doesnâ€™t?), but at the end of the day, itâ€™s us who stayed together. Since then, every New Year has started with us being together, a tradition that means the world to us.
Today, weâ€™re seven unique individuals who chose different paths after school, from different streams in Intermediate to different careers. But no matter where life takes us,weâ€™re always the Chunky Monkeys.</p>
